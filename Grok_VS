The Virtual Service is correct but there is one problem when we put the whole configuration together. The routing rules for this host dev.epay.sbi is not defined in a single Virtual Service and we cannot determine their order of precedence, ideally, when they are defined in a single file they are evaluated in sequential order from top to bottom.

Given the above configuration (5 VSs in dev-frontend NS + the VS in dev-istio-system), when a client access the application --> https://dev.epay.sbi/transactiontracking the request is forwarded to websitefe-epay-website svc as the matching rule is more specific and taking more precedence over what is defined in the VS in dev-istio-system for routing the request to maintenancefe-maintenance-frontend.dev-frontend.svc.cluster.local svc.

Suggestion

Delete all the Virtual Services in dev-frontend that are defining the host dev.epay.sbi individually.
Merge all the Virtual service that are defining the same host in a single file.[2]
During the maintenance period keep the following Virtual Service only that will route the traffic to the maintenance service.
